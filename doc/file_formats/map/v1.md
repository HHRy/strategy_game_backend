This document describes the structure of a map file for the RTS
Engine.

Current Version:  **1**

## File Definition

  -  **File Extension:**  `.rtsmap`
  -  **File Composition:**  A single JSON object

## Contents of the File

The following objects make up the contents of a valid map file.

### General Structure

| Attributes        | Required | Type                      | Default Value      | Purpose
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ | -------
| version           | Yes      | Integer                   | `1`                | The version of the map file format being considered
| format            | Yes      | String                    | `"2D"`             | The format of the map. Will probably always be 2D
| players           | Yes      | Integer                   | `2`                | The number of players that this map is designed for
| width             | Yes      | Integer                   | `800`              | The width of the map in tiles
| height            | Yes      | Integer                   | `600`              | The height of the map in tiles
| theme             | Yes      | String                    | `"default"`        | The theme is the set of tiles used when displaying the map.
| name              | Yes      | Localized String Object   |                    | The name of the map, localized
| startingPositions | Yes      | Array of Position Objects |                    | A list of points on the map where players will start the game
| waterAreas        | No       | Array of Area Objects     |                    | Areas of the map which are water
| resourceAreas     | No       | Array of Area Objects     |                    | Areas of the map which contain harvestable resources
| obstacleAreas     | No       | Array of Area Objects     |                    | Areas of the map which can not be passed by land or sea

### Localized Strings

Must be at least one key-value pair in the following format:

```json
  {
    "en": "content",
    "fr": "content"
  }
```

The key is expected to be an ISO language code. I don't think it matters right
now which kind you use, so `en` and `en_GB` are both valid.

### Position Objects

Position objects mark out  the starting position for a player on the map.

| Attributes        | Required | Type                      | Default Value      |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| x                 | Yes      | Integer                   | `1`                |
| y                 | Yes      | Integer                   | `2`               |

### Area Objects

Area object define an area on the map that has a special purpose.


| Attributes        | Required | Type                      | Default Value      |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| x                 | Yes      | Integer                   | `1`                |
| y                 | Yes      | Integer                   | `2`               |
| width             | Yes      | Integer                   | `1`                |
| height            | Yes      | Integer                   | `2`               |

## Validation

All required fields must be present. If they are not present, and a default
is specified then that value will be assumed.

The file must pass a JSON lint.

### Starting Position validation

  - Starting position must be no closer than 3 tiles to any of the map
    borders.
  - All coordinates must be > 0
  - Must be within the bounds of the map
  - Starting positions must not be within 200 tiles of each-other.
  - The number of entries in startingPositions must match the number of
    players
  - Can not be places within an `obstacleArea`

### Localized String Object validation

  - Must contain at least one key/value pair.
  - Key must be a valid ISO language code
  - Value must be a UTF-8 or UTF-16 string

### Area Object validation

  - Can not overlap with other area objects.
  - Must have an area of at least 1 tile
  - Must be within the width and height bounds of the map
